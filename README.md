# Polaris Navigator

A polar alignment assistant device for astrophotography using AtomS3R (with IMU) and AtomicBase GPS.

## Overview

Polaris Navigator is a compact, portable device designed to assist astrophotographers with polar alignment. It uses IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and GPS data to visualize the alignment error between your telescope/camera and the celestial pole (North/South).

## Features

- **Polar Alignment Assistance**: Calculates and displays azimuth and altitude errors relative to the celestial pole
- **Celestial Object Tracking**: Shows the direction of the sun and moon
- **Moon Phase Display**: Calculates and displays the current moon phase
- **GPS Data Display**: Shows raw GPS data including latitude, longitude, and satellite status
- **IMU Data Display**: Displays raw accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data for calibration

## Hardware

- AtomS3R (with built-in IMU)
- AtomicBase GPS
- Display device (built-in LCD or OLED)

## Development Status

This project is currently under development.
